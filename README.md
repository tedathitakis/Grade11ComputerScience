# HighschoolComputerScience
/Grade 11/
orginaly created on repl.it
at this point I didn't follow a proper naming sceem
covid ended the course short so I only learned up to arrays
/Grade 12/
Taken in online nightschool in a split class
    -barely any teaching time
90% self taught
fastest and most demanding course I had during highschool
Most of the code was orginally created in replit but moved to eclispse when recursion was to demanding for replit
